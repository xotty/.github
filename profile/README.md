Something I've been working on:

* [yapu-rs](https://github.com/yapu-rs/yapu): Yet Another Programmer via USART (AN3155-compliant)

GitHub has a poor granularity on profile visibility: I just don't want GitHub to
either show every activity / "contribution" on my profile, or completely hide
the past history and other useful info.

After reading [Why are my contributions not showing up on my profile?][1], there
are some ways to prevent commits showing up:

* ~~create an alt account or defect to providers like [Codeberg][codeberg]~~
* make commits in *non-default* branches;
* make commits in a *fork* (could be forked from your empty template);
* make commits in a repository that is *not associated with your main account*
  - remember that an associated repository could result from
    + being an owner / collaborator / contributor of that repository

The approach I've been taking is to

* create an organization / repository *from an alt account*
* push commits *from an alt account*
* commits *can* be authored and PGP signed by your main account though
